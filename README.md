# RoverSentry
An autonomous land based drone based upon ArduPilot and RaspberryPi.

----

RoverSentry is a project that will transform a standard RC Car into robotic sentry that will circle the property and take pictures of any suspicious activity it encounters. 
Once programmed with the patrol path the RoverSentry is autonomous and will continue its patrol until the entire patrol path has been traversed. 
A web application will be created that will be able to view video from the rover at any time, snap and upload pictures, and take control of the Rover.

RoverSentry is based upon the ArduRover project but adds a Raspberry Pi for taking video/still picures, and adding sensors (heat, movement, light, etc). 
A Turnigy Buggy (RC Car ) will be modified to house an APM 2.6 autopilot controller board along with the Raspberry Pi, a GPS receiver, a Camera with night vision, and sensors, raspicam.

# Web Application
The Rover Sentry web application provides a basic user interface to monitor and modify the Rover Sentry in real time. Some functions include taking snapshots of the live video feed, stopping and setting mission way points, and viewing the photo gallery.

The web application is modular and scalable to run on computers, tablets, and smartphones.

The main page in the web application displays the live video feed of the RoverSentry as well as a control board for basic functionality.
